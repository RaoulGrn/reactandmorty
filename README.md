# Reactandmorty

This project was made for us to learn how to work with an randomly given API in React.
You can search for any character or location from the show "Rick and Morty". After sending the query, each of the characters or locations will arrive in a card format for you to read. Also, we have imported a spotify widget so you can listen to the soundtrack while reading about your favorite characters!
Enjoy!
